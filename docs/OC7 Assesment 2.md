# Software Quality Review: Hospital Database Management System

## Part 1: ISO/IEC 25010:2011 Standard Analysis

### 1. Functional Suitability

**Why it matters for our hospital database:**

Our hospital database app handles critical healthcare data - patient info, doctor details, visits, prescriptions, and insurance details. Getting the functionality right is absolutely essential since this directly impacts patient care, insurance claims, and staying compliant with healthcare regulations.

**How I've addressed this:**

Complete data management: I've implemented full CRUD operations for all main entities through dedicated DAO classes:

```java
public class PatientDAO implements BaseDAO<Patient> {
    @Override
    public void save(Patient patient) throws DatabaseException {...}
    @Override
    public void update(Patient patient) {...}
    @Override
    public void delete(String... ids) {...}
    @Override
    public Patient get(String... ids) {...}
    @Override
    public List<Patient> getAll() {...}
}
```

Comprehensive coverage: The system meets all the requirements in our project brief, handling everything from patient data to prescriptions and insurance details.

Data validation: I've built a dedicated validation system to ensure data integrity:

```java
public class ValidationConfig {
    private static final Map<String, FieldValidation[]> VALIDATION_RULES = new HashMap<>();

    static {
        VALIDATION_RULES.put("patient", new FieldValidation[] {
            new FieldValidation("patientID", 10, true, "^[A-Z0-9]+$", "Patient ID must be alphanumeric and uppercase"),
            // Other validation rules...
        });
    }
}
```

Powerful search: Users can find records using various criteria:

```java
public List<Patient> findByFirstName(String firstName) {...}
public List<Patient> findByLastName(String lastName) {...}
public List<Patient> findByPostcode(String postcode) {...}
```

**How this aligns with our project goals:**

This directly fulfills my requirement to "develop an application for a Hospital database for a mid-size health insurance company to keep track of health claims." The app efficiently manages all the required data with proper validation and relationship tracking.

### 2. Security

**Why it matters for our hospital database:**

I'm dealing with sensitive patient health info that's protected by regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Security isn't optional - it's essential to protect patient privacy, prevent data breaches, and stay compliant with healthcare laws.

**How I've addressed this:**

Input validation: I've implemented thorough validation to prevent SQL injection and bad data:

```java
public class FieldValidation {
    private final String fieldName;
    private final int maxLength;
    private final boolean required;
    private final String pattern;
    private final String errorMessage;
}
```

Safe database queries: All database interactions use prepared statements:

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM patient WHERE patientID = ?";
try (Connection conn = DatabaseConnection.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query)) {
    stmt.setString(1, ids[0]);
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
    // Process results...
}
```

Exception handling: I've implemented proper exception management to prevent information leakage:

```java
try {
    // Database operations
} catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new DatabaseException("Error saving patient: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

Database connection security: Database credentials are stored securely:

```java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/assesment_hospital";
private static final String USER = "root";
private static final String PASSWORD = "root";
```

**How this aligns with our project goals:**

This approach ensures I'm handling sensitive healthcare data responsibly. For a production environment, I'd add encryption, access control, and audit logging.

### 3. Maintainability

**Why it matters for our hospital database:**

Healthcare systems typically stick around for years and need frequent updates as regulations, medical practices, and organizational needs change. Building for maintainability means I can efficiently modify, enhance, and debug the system over time without massive rewrites.

**How I've addressed this:**

Organized code structure: I've organized the codebase into clear packages:

```
src/
├── main/
│   └── java/
│       └── com/
│           └── hospital/
│               ├── dao/         # Data Access Objects
│               ├── exceptions/  # Custom Exceptions
│               ├── gui/         # User Interface
│               ├── models/      # Data Models
│               ├── utils/       # Utilities
│               └── validation/  # Input Validation
```

Design patterns: I've used several proven design patterns:

- DAO pattern for database operations
- Factory pattern for creating forms and DAOs
- MVC architecture for separation of concerns

Code reuse: I've used abstract classes and interfaces to promote reusability:

```java
public interface BaseDAO<T> {
    void save(T entity) throws DatabaseException;
    void update(T entity) throws DatabaseException;
    void delete(String... ids) throws DatabaseException;
    T get(String... ids) throws DatabaseException;
    List<T> getAll() throws DatabaseException;
}
```

Smart inheritance: I've used inheritance to reduce code duplication:

```java
public abstract class Person {
    // Common person attributes and methods
}

public class Patient extends Person {
    // Patient-specific attributes and methods
}

public class Doctor extends Person {
    // Doctor-specific attributes and methods
}
```

Clear naming: I've used consistent, descriptive naming throughout the codebase.

**How this aligns with our project goals:**

This approach supports the long-term viability of the system, particularly for the future requirement that "eventually, the application will be used to track trends and for some extrapolative modelling based on the accumulated data." A maintainable codebase will make it much easier for me to add these analytical capabilities later.

## Part 2: Code Quality Review

### 1. Readability

**Why it matters for our hospital database:**

In healthcare apps, code clarity directly impacts patient safety and data integrity. Unclear code can lead to misinterpretations that cause critical errors in patient data or treatment information.

**Current state of my code:**

Consistent formatting: My code maintains consistent indentation and structure:

```java
public void createTable(String tableType) {
    try {
        // Get the DAO from the factory
        BaseDAO<?> dao = DAOFactory.getDAO(tableType);

        // Create table with CustomTableModel
        JTable table = new JTable(new CustomTableModel(dao.getAll(), tableType));

        // Add table formatting
        table.setAutoResizeMode(JTable.AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS);
        table.getTableHeader().setReorderingAllowed(false);
        table.setRowHeight(25);
        table.setAutoCreateRowSorter(true);

        // Update panel
        JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(table);
        mainPanel.removeAll();
        mainPanel.add(scrollPane, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        mainPanel.revalidate();
        mainPanel.repaint();

        // Add right-click functionality
        new TableRightClick(table, tableType);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(
            this,
            "Error creating table: " + ex.getMessage(),
            "Error",
            JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE
        );
    }
}
```

Descriptive method names: My methods clearly indicate what they do:

```java
private void viewDoctorTable() {...}
private void showPrescriptionForm() {...}
private <T> void showForm(String type, T entity) {...}
```

Organized constants: I've grouped constants logically with clear names:

```java
// Constants for table types
private static final String DOCTOR = "doctor";
private static final String PATIENT = "patient";
private static final String DRUG = "drug";
private static final String INSURANCE = "insurance";
private static final String PRESCRIPTION = "prescription";
private static final String VISIT = "visit";
```

Comments: I have some good comments, but they could be more consistent:

```java
// Method to display search results depending on the different keys, search types and search parameters in different tables
public void ResultSet(String tableType, String searchType, String... searchParams) {...}
```

**How I plan to improve readability:**

Add proper JavaDoc: I'll add comprehensive JavaDoc comments for public methods, classes, and interfaces:

```java
/**
 * Creates and displays a table based on the specified table type.
 *
 * @param tableType The type of table to create (patient, doctor, etc.)
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the table type is invalid
 */
public void createTable(String tableType) {...}
```

Implement code reviews: I'll set up peer code reviews focused on readability, using a checklist:

- Are method and variable names clear and descriptive?
- Are complex algorithms properly explained?
- Is the code formatting consistent?
- Are there any overly complex methods that need refactoring?

Use readability metrics: I'll use tools like SonarQube to measure and track code complexity.

Follow a style guide: I'll adopt and stick to Google's Java Style Guide for consistent coding style.

### 2. Maintainability

**Why it matters for our hospital database:**

Healthcare systems need frequent updates to adapt to changing regulations, insurance requirements, and hospital processes. Having maintainable code means I can make these changes quickly, cost-effectively, and with minimal risk of introducing bugs.

**Current state of my code:**

Separation of concerns: I've properly separated data access, business logic, and presentation:

```java
// Data Access Layer (DAO)
public class PatientDAO implements BaseDAO<Patient> {...}

// Business Model
public class Patient extends Person {...}

// Presentation Layer
public class PatientForm extends BaseForm<Patient> {...}
```

Abstraction and inheritance: I'm using inheritance effectively:

```java
public abstract class BaseForm<T> {...}
public class PatientForm extends BaseForm<Patient> {...}
public class DoctorForm extends BaseForm<Doctor> {...}
```

Some code duplication: I have some repetitive code, especially in UI event handlers:

```java
searchByKeys.addActionListener(event -> {
    patientIDField.setEnabled(true);
    firstNameField.setEnabled(false);
    lastNameField.setEnabled(false);
    // Similar code repeated for other fields
});
searchByFirstName.addActionListener(event -> {
    patientIDField.setEnabled(false);
    firstNameField.setEnabled(true);
    lastNameField.setEnabled(false);
    // Similar code repeated for other fields
});
```

Inconsistent exception handling: My exception handling varies across the codebase:

```java
catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace(); // Some methods only print stack traces
}

catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new DatabaseException("Error retrieving visit: " + e.getMessage()); // Others throw custom exceptions
}
```

**How I plan to improve maintainability:**

Refactoring plan:

- I'll create helper methods for repetitive UI field operations
- I'll standardize exception handling across all DAO classes
- I'll extract complex switch statements into separate strategy classes

Add unit tests: I'll implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure refactoring doesn't break anything:

```java
@Test
public void testPatientGetAll() {
    PatientDAO dao = new PatientDAO();
    List<Patient> patients = dao.getAll();
    assertNotNull(patients);
    assertFalse(patients.isEmpty());
}
```

Track code quality metrics:

- I'll set maximum complexity thresholds
- I'll monitor and reduce code duplication
- I'll set minimum test coverage requirements

Improve documentation:

- I'll create technical documentation with data flow diagrams
- I'll document the database schema and relationships
- I'll maintain a changelog for system modifications

Set up continuous integration:

- I'll implement automated testing
- I'll add static code analysis
- I'll enforce quality gates before allowing code to be merged
